# Changelog

All notable changes to the IAB Tech Lab Seller Agent are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- MCP Streamable HTTP transport at `/mcp` (current MCP standard, protocol 2025-06-18) — resolves buyer agent 405 errors on MCP connection
- Legacy HTTP+SSE transport kept at `/mcp-sse/sse` for backwards compatibility with older Claude Desktop / ChatGPT clients
- FreeWheel OAuth 2.1 PKCE authentication integration (seller-91t):
  - Streaming Hub: interactive bootstrap via `ad-seller freewheel-login --provider sh`, then bearer auth to `/mcp/oauth`
  - Buyer Cloud: interactive bootstrap via `ad-seller freewheel-login --provider bc`, then bearer auth to `/mcp/oauth`
  - Legacy SH/BC login-tool credential paths removed (`streaming_hub_login`, `buyer_cloud_login`)
  - Auto-refresh and reconnect on access-token expiry for both SH and BC
  - Connection validation via `reconnect()` method on MCP client
- CSV ad server adapter with full CRUD and atomic writes (61 tests)
- 9 MCP prompts (slash commands) for Claude Desktop/web (/setup, /status, /inventory, /deals, /queue, /new-deal, /configure, /buyers, /help)
- 3 composite tools: get_inbound_queue, get_buyer_activity, list_configurable_flows
- Comprehensive unit tests (86 new tests) and integration tests (38 new tests)
- Troubleshooting guide
- Buyer agent compatibility report

### Changed
- Renamed "Deal Jockey" to "Deal Library" across codebase and documentation
- Linted and formatted entire codebase with ruff
- Removed `FREEWHEEL_BC_CLIENT_ID` and `FREEWHEEL_BC_CLIENT_SECRET` settings (Beeswax uses session cookie auth, not OAuth client_credentials)

### Fixed
- Documentation tool count (41 MCP tools, not "45+")
- Documentation endpoint count (82 REST endpoints, not "70+")
- Port typo in media-kit guide (8001 → 8000)
